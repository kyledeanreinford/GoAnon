I wanted a quick way to become anonymous for torrenting, so I built this dock item. 

An Ubuntu dock icon that connects to Private Internet Access VPN, then opens ThePirateBay in browser and Deluge. Must have PIA process running for it to connect using CLI.

.desktop file must be placed in {user}/.local/share/applications

Right click on icon and add to favorites to add icon to Ubuntu dock.

Requires Python.
